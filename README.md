# machine problem II: rsa-oaep encryption and decryption with signing

## what?
- RSA-OAEP encrypt then sign -> verify then decrypt
- multiple signing methods

## Functions roadmap
- [x] RSA key generation
- [x] RSA-OAEP encryption
- [x] RSA-OAEP decryption
- [x] HMAC signing
- [x] HMAC verification
- [!] CMAC signing       ! discontinued
- [!] CMAC verification  ! discontinued
- [x] RSA pkcs1v15 signing
- [x] RSA pkcs1v15 verification
- [x] RSA pss signing
- [x] RSA pss verification
- [ ] RSA-OAEP encrypt then sign -> verify then decrypt
